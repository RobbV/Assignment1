    <p>
      The Fractal Design Define S lends the appearance, sound dampening technology, and support for a wide variety of components from the widely popular Define Series, while introducing a new, innovative internal layout. The Define S case is packed with intelligently designed enthusiast-oriented features delivering a silent case with powerful and expansive air and liquid cooling support, presented in a stunning Scandinavian inspired construction.
      The modernized internal layout of the Define S omits the optical drive bays, instead focusing on a clear straight airflow path and uncompromising water cooling support.
      The Define S case reaches the highest level of silent computing through strategically placed dense sound-absorbing material, multiple ModuVentâ„¢ fan vent covers and finely tuned Dynamic Series fans.
